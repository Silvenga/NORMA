Constraint Implication and Contradiction
	- Constraint Implied by Intersecting Constraints
	- Contradicting Exclusion and Equality Constraints
	- Contradicting Exclusion and Mandatory Constraints
	- Contradicting Exclusion and Subset Constraints
	- Contradicting Frequency and Internal Uniqueness Constraints
	- Contradicting Subset and Mandatory Constraints
	- Equality Constraint Implied By Mandatory Constraint(s)
	- Mandatory Constraint Implies Equality or Subset Constraint
Constraint Structure Errors
	- Constraint Role Sequences with Different Number of Roles
	- Incompatible Constrained Role Players
	- Inconsistent Frequency Constraint Minimum and Maximum Values
	- Ring Constraint Type Not Specified
	- Too Few Role Sequences
	- Too Many Role Sequences
DataType and Value
	- DataType not Specified for ValueType
	- Maximum Bound of Value Range Invalid for DataType
	- Minimum Bound of Value Range Invalid for DataType
	- Value Ranges Overlap
	** Value Ranges are out of bounds according to constraint.
Fact Type Definition
	- FactType has Fewer Role than Reading Text
	- FactType has Implied Internal Uniqueness Constraint
	- FactType has More Roles than Reading Text
	- FactType Requires Internal Uniqueness Constraint
	- FactType Requires Reading
	- Insufficient Roles for Internal Uniqueness Constraint(s)
	- Reading Text Automatically Modified
	- Role Player Required
Naming
	- Duplicate Constraint Name
	- Duplicate ObjectType Names
Reference Scheme
	- EntityType Requires Reference Scheme
	- EntityType with Compound Preferred Identifier Requires Mandatory Constraint
	- Incompatible or Transitive Supertypes
	- ObjectType Requires Primary Supertype
Sample Population
	- Incomplete FactType Sample Population
	- Incomplete Sample Population to Identify EntityType
	- Missing Mandatory Sample Population
	- Population Violates Uniqueness Constraint
	- Sample Population Value Invalid for DataType
