	RoleStateVariant:

Short Name
Description
HasRolePlayer 
The role is associated with an entity type, value type, or objectified fact type
DoesNotHaveRolePlayer
The role is not associated with an entity type, value type, or objectified fact type
RoleDoesNotExist
The role does not exist.


Test Cases

	Error exists when it should: 
	Error should appear when role is not associated with an entity type.
	Error should appear when role is not associated with a value type.
	Error should appear when role is not associated with an objectified fact type.

	Error does not exist when it shouldn’t:
	Fact Type is properly associated with an entity type
	Fact Type is properly associated with a value type
	Fact Type is properly associated with an objectified fact type




	Test Plan for feature for ImpliedInternalUniquenessConstraintError:

Definition of Error

	An internal uniqueness constraint is implied if it includes the same roles as another internal uniqueness constraint. The roles may be equal, or there may be more roles in the applied constraint.
	Role order (not displayed on a diagram, but stored in the model and file based on the order the items are entered) should not matter.
	A FactType will have a single ImpliedInternalUniquenessConstraintError regardless of the number of implied constraints. For example, a binary fact type with two alethic uniqueness constraints on one role and a spanning uniqueness constraint will have a single error on the FactType (the individual constraints may have other errors, but this error is on the FactType itself, not the constraints).
	Alethic constraints imply deontic constraints, but not vice versa.
