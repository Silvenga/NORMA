(IGNORING THE PRIMARY REFERENCE SCHEME)

One to one, no mandatories
	ABSORB FACT towards role player with more functional roles
	
One to one, one mandatory
	If role player on non-mandatory role plays at least one OTHER functional role, FULLY ABSORB towards non-mandatory role player
	Else ABSORB FACT towards mandatory role player
	
One to one, both mandatory
	FULLY ABSORB towards role player with more functional roles


For getting count of functional roles, do we include other instances of one-to-one binaries???
For getting count of functional roles, we always exclude the preferred reference mode.



Ignore the below stuff, it is wrong:

(IGNORING THE PRIMARY REFERENCE SCHEME)

For an object type 'OT' (ignoring the primary reference scheme):

If an object type plays no mandatory roles:
	

If an object type plays exactly one mandatory roles:
	

If an object type plays more than one mandatory roles:
	




ObjectType is top-level if ANY of the following:
	1) It is marked independent
	2) It plays at least one functional role in a fact type that it is not functionally dependent on,
		and plays zero or more than one mandatory functional roles in fact types that it is functionally dependent on
	
	
	
	
ObjectType is NOT top-level AND may be absorbed if ALL of the following:
	1) It is NOT marked independent
	2)
		(IGNORING THE PRIMARY REFERENCE SCHEME)
		a) It plays exactly one mandatory functional roles in a fact type that it is functionally dependent on
		OR
		b) It plays no functional roles
