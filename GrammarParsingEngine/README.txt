We (Scott Baldwin and Nickolas Maly), were initially using the kilmstra engine to integrate into the fact editing components. However, we were unable to get that far, and were stuck with using the GOLD Parser builder to create our grammar file. See the GOLD web site for information (and alternatives) on the kilmstra engine.
